# kik-bot

This is a kik bot made to be run in with a emulator like genymotion with the help of adb, it auto replies in accordance to messages it recieves in groups(doesn't work right with PM's)

This bot has been made to work with pikek(night), for it work with other kik mods, you would need to change the location of your kik database accordingly

All the constant replies such as "!credits", "!hey", "!help" would need to be added as commands in your kik so as to increase the speed of the bot

This bot actually copies the text to its clipboard using xclip and then taps according to the position of the paste button in your keyboard, so you might need to get a keyboard with a paste button for it to work and change the taps accordingly

I have also embeded a sample Rock Paper Scissors game in the bot, but you can add and delete your games

There is also a bunch of things like "!say" in which the bot says what the person has said, and some other things like "!revsay" and "!cowsay" in which it says what the person has said and with different designs, it also greets the persons which joins and leaves the chats

**You would first need to connect adb to your emulator by "adb connect IP"

This bot has been used with Samsung S3 emulator in genymotion and you can use any keyboard which has a paste button by configuring the taps
